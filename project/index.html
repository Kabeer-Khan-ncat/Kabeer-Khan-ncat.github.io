<!-- This is the navigation bar across all the pages and contains links to the
other pages of the website. Mainly, I have four main pages in my project, which
are:
(1) “index.html”: my home page, which provides an overview of the website's
purpose and highlights key information.
(2) “forum.html”: Forum allows users to exchange ideas and solutions, fostering
community interaction.
(3) “contact-us.html”: Contact Us page provides visitors with contact forms,
email addresses, and phone numbers to reach out directly.
(4) “about.html”: About Us page offers background information about the
company, its history, and its mission. -->
